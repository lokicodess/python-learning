can you give me the summary of the pdf ? ,"The story ""The Little Fox's Adventure"" follows Fina, a curious and adventurous fox.  She discovers a map leading to hidden treasure deep in the woods.  Along her journey, she encounters and befriends various animals, overcoming challenges with courage and kindness.  Finally, she reaches an ancient tree and finds a glowing stone, a symbol of courage and friendship, rather than gold or jewels.  Fina returns home, celebrated not for the treasure but for her bravery and the journey she undertook.
