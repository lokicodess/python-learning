PANDAS

- Can analyze big data , clean,  readable and relevant  

 SERIES 
 - column in a table ( 1D array)
 - we can pass index arg to label the custom data
 - In case of dictionary, key becomes the labels

 DATAFRAME
 - Unlike series, it has 2D data.
 - we can work with .csv files(to store large data)
 - Always convert df.to_string() to get full data, otherwise it will return 5 rows from start and end only
 - it can only maximum print 60 rows. we can change it by calling
      pd.options.display.max_rows = 99999
 - we can work same with json

VIEW DATA
 - we can see the upper rows by calling head(no of rows wants to see) method, same there is a tail method.
 - we can get the info about the dataset by calling info method

DATA MANIPULATION
- Adding rows/columns
  columns: df["column name"] = data
  df.loc[len(df.index)] = [data]

- Removing rows/columns
  df.drop(index = index, axis = 0)
  df.drop("column name", axis = 1)
  
- Renaming rows/columns


DATA CLEANING

- defna() method for cleaning empty rows and returning new row , use inplace = "true" for in place change.
- fillna() method we can choose for filling instead of directly deleting
